                                After watching numerous videos on YouTube and reading every PC assembling tutorial on the
                                internet, I had finally saved enough, to build my first gaming system. Ever since then
                                I became even more interested in PC Hardware and have upgraded my system 3 times.
                                It is still standing strong, rocking every Video Game title, which comes out, while suiting
                                every other of my needs, requiring computing power.</p>

                            I enrolled in Itchen Sixth Form College in Southampton, where I started studying Level 2 IT, however I was moved
                            to Level 3 as I finished most of the work for the year in a month. At first it was a new and strange experience,
                            however, once I got to know the people around, it became amazing. I learned so much outside of my course material
                            from the teachers there and got to know a lot of interesting and different people.

                            real-world company. I wanted the company to be a technology one, therefore, with some help, I managed to get a placement
                            for a week in a newtorking company called HighPoint Solutions. In the week I spend there, I saw a lot of real-life Networking
                            hardware, and even got to work with and help with troubleshooting some of it. I also got to meet a lot of great and smart people
                            and see how work flows in real-life tech companies.

                            year of my Level 3 IT Course and I had also enrolled in an Applied Science course, in which i got a Merit, as Science isn't one of my
                            strongest areas. It was an amazing, enriching and interesting experience, as I met people from all around the world, and it was my first

                            I enrolled in Solent University's Cyber Security Management course, which I love so far, as I'm naturally interested in 
                            things regarding security, and I hope that one day I will become a good Penetration Tester. The first semester of the course
                            I finished my 3 Subjects with quite good grades, got A1 in Problem Solving through Programming, 74% In Cisco's Introduction to Networks
                            and around 80% in Cyber Security Essentials.

                            In November, 2019 I was introduced something quite interesting by my programming tutor at Uni.
                            I got introduced to Hackathons, which are events, where a lot of computer specialists, students and 
                            enthusiasts gather to test their skills in a competition, which can lasts from 24 hours to a few days.
                            Although the main point of Hackathons is the competition, they are amazing places to meet like-minded people,
                            enrich your knowledge about vast variety of areas and most important, have fun. So in November, 2019 my tutor
                            mentioned that he is gathering a group for a hackathon, which was taking place in the following days. Although, I had 
                            second thoughts about it, I went and it was one of the most interesting experiences. I got to meet a lot of clever,
                            skilled in the technology area, people. I'm still incredibly grateful to my tutor, for introducing me to these events
                            and making it even a greater experience, than it is on its own.

                            Univeristy allowed us to study remotely. For my time in Bulgaria, I focused on getting experience in IT before graduating.
                            I got a job as a Monitoring Specialist in the NOC Team of Draft Kings, which so far has been amazing, it let me learn a lot of things
                            on how massive corporations work, I got hands-on experience with corporate communication tools such as Slack, Jira and Confluence. Aside from this 
                            I got to work with tools such as Zabbix, PRTG, got a certificate for my ability to work with Pager Duty, and the most important thing, due to the 
                            nature of the work, I've been doing, I managed to meet and talk to many great IT professionals, ranging from Infrastructure engineers, to Database Engineers,
